  ## Screenshots-Demo
  Here is the demo to show the given application I will write the tutorial for.

  ## Project Objective
  When joining a new team, the new team member will be expected to inspect a lot of code that he/she has never seen before. Rather than having another team member explain every line, the new team member will dissect the code by him/herself, saving any questions for another member of the team.

  This project requires to reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code. 

  ## User Story
  GIVEN a Node.js application using Sequelize and Passport,
  WHEN I follow the walkthrough,
  THEN I understand the codebase. 

  ## Technologies 
  ```
  Javascript, HTML, express, express-session, passport, sequelize, Mysql, bcryptjs
  ```
  
  ## Installation
  Access to GitHub.com and a code editor such as vscode is necessary. Click the GitHub link provided above to the APP REPO. Click on the green button that says Clone or Download and Choose how you would like to download: using the SSH/HTTPS keys or download the zip file. If using SSH/HTTPS Key: You will copy the link shown and open up either terminal (mac: pre-installed) or gitbash (pc: must be installed). Once the application is open, you will type git clone paste url here. If using Download ZIP: Click on Download Zip. Locate the file and double click it to unzip the file. Locate the unzipped folder and open it. 

  ## Usage 
  In order to use this APP, you need terminal (mac: pre-installed) or gitbash (pc: must be installed). You also need to download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager. Open the cloned REPO in your favorite code editor, and then in terminal, enter the command “ npm i “ or “yarn add”  to install the dependencies. Make sure to create a .env file on the project root, and input your own Mysql Workbench config information (see .env_example for samples). Now you are ready to start using  the app by entering “npm start” on your terminal or gitbash.
